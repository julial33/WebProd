<p>I am a sophomore at the George Washington University studying political communication in the School of Media and Public Affairs. I am involved in Epsilon Sigma Alpha, a community service sorority, and I serve as the community service chair for the GW chapter of the National Society of Leadership and Success. I work at the National Museum of Natural History and intern at the Interior Department. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing soccer, and walking my dog.</p>
